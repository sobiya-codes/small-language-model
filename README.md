## 🔹 Project Overview
This project implements a **GPT-style transformer** from scratch to create a **Small Language Model (SLM)** with ~50-60 million parameters.  

The model is trained on **TinyStories**, a synthetic dataset of short stories for young children, to generate coherent and creative text.  

The project demonstrates:
- Efficient dataset preprocessing into binary files (`train.bin`, `val.bin`)  
- Tokenization using the GPT-2 tokenizer (`tiktoken`)  
- Custom transformer model with **multi-head causal self-attention, MLP blocks, residual connections, and layer normalization**  
- Mixed precision training with gradient accumulation and clipping  
- Text generation using temperature and top-k sampling

---

## 🔹 Features
- ✅ Efficient preprocessing with memory-friendly binary token files  
- ✅ GPT-style transformer with ~50M parameters  
- ✅ Multi-head causal self-attention and MLP blocks  
- ✅ LayerNorm and residual connections for stable training  
- ✅ Mixed precision training for faster GPU execution  
- ✅ Gradient accumulation and gradient clipping for stable optimization  
- ✅ Text generation with configurable prompts, temperature, and top-k

## 🔹 Dataset
- **Name:** TinyStories  
- **Source:** [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories)  
- **Description:** Short stories with words understandable by 3–4-year-olds  
- **Preprocessing:** Tokenized and stored as `train.bin` and `val.bin` for efficient batch training  

> Note: The dataset is not included in the repo due to size. Use `data_preparation.py` to download and preprocess it.

---

## 🔹 Model Architecture
- **Embedding Layer:** Token + positional embeddings  
- **Transformer Blocks:** 6 blocks, each with:
  - Multi-head causal self-attention (6 heads)  
  - Feed-forward MLP (hidden dim = 4 × embedding dim)  
  - LayerNorm and residual connections  
- **Output Layer:** Linear projection to vocabulary size (50257)  

**Hyperparameters:**
- Layers: 6  
- Embedding dim: 384  
- Heads: 6  
- Context window (block size): 128  
- Dropout: 0.1  
- Optimizer: AdamW with cosine decay & warmup

## 🔹 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/slm-project.git
cd slm-project

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Linux / Mac
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🔹 Usage

### 1️⃣ Prepare Dataset

```bash
python data_preparation.py
```

This downloads TinyStories, tokenizes it using GPT-2 tokenizer, and saves `train.bin` and `val.bin` in the `data/` folder.

### 2️⃣ Train the Model

```bash
python train.py
```

* Trains the SLM using AdamW optimizer, gradient clipping, and mixed precision.
* Model checkpoints are saved in `saved_models/model.pt`.

### 3️⃣ Run Inference

```bash
python inference.py
```

* Generate text from a prompt using the trained model.
* Configurable parameters: `max_new_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_k`.

**Example:**

```python
prompt = "Once upon a time"
print(generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=100, temperature=1.0))
```

## 🔹 Training Details

* Max iterations: 20,000
* Batch size: 32
* Gradient accumulation steps: 32
* Block size (context window): 128
* Learning rate: 1e-4
* Optimizer: AdamW (β1=0.9, β2=0.95, weight\_decay=0.1)
* Scheduler: Linear warmup + Cosine decay
* Mixed precision: `float16` or `bfloat16` depending on GPU

> Tip: For smaller GPUs, reduce `batch_size` or `block_size`.

---

## 🔹 Results

* Training and validation loss decrease steadily.
* **Generated text example:**

```
Prompt: "A little girl went to the woods"
Generated: "A little girl went to the woods. She saw a tiny house with a cat sitting by the door..."
```

## 🔹 Future Improvements

* Train on a larger dataset for better story coherence
* Extend block size to capture longer context
* Implement nucleus/top-p sampling for more diverse text
* Deploy as a web-based interactive text generator
