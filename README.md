# Small Language Model (SLM) from Scratch 👩‍💻

![Project Demo](assets/demo.gif)  

A **Small Language Model (SLM)** trained on [TinyStories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories) dataset to generate creative and coherent text.  
This project is implemented from scratch in **PyTorch**, inspired by the work of **Vizuara AI Labs**.

## 🌟 Features

- Small-scale GPT-like architecture (~50-60M parameters)  
- Trained on TinyStories dataset (kid-friendly short stories)  
- Causal self-attention for next-token prediction  
- Mixed precision training for faster computation  
- Generate text given a prompt with controllable length and randomness
